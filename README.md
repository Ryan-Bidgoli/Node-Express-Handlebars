### Instructions

1. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

2. Each burger has a button that when the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

3. Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
